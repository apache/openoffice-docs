# Corrections from Jean.

## Formatting

1) Page 3, near the top, "What You See May Be Different" should be a Heading 1. AOO41GS1.odt (Preface).

2) Page 63, There appears to be an extra table row below the Tip, causing an extra border to appear. AOO41GS4.odt (Chapter 3).

3) Page 124, There is a blank table row at the top of the page. AOO41SG6.odt (Chapter 5).

4) Page 154, Figure 136 falls into the bottom footer/margin, probably caused by an extra-large space above the heading "Rulers". This space appears to be due to the frame enclosing Figure 134. AOO41GS7. odt (Chapter 6).

5) Page 178, blank page, should be removed. AOO41GS7(Chapter6).

6) Page 181, Extra blank paragraph at top of page, pushing the heading down. Remove blank paragraph. AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

7) Page 186: step 1), "Error: Reference source not found". AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

8) Page 187, page break leaving large space at bottom for no apparent reason. AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

9)  Page 188, Figure 164 is too far off to the right, probably not anchored correctly. AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

10) Page 210, Figure 187 is escaping off the top of the page. Probably not anchored correctly. AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

 Page 220, Too much space above heading "Creating Reports". AOO41GS8.odt (Chapter 7).

## Incorrect x-refs: (I have no idea how these got all goofed up). There probably are more.
