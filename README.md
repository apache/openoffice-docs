# Apache OpenOffice Documentation Project

## Repository for Apache OpenOffice Documentation

This repository will be used for Revision Control for all master Documentation files for Apache OpenOfficeÂ® (AOO). Documentation will be written primarily using Writer, the word processing component of AOO, as well as other components as needed.

### Structure

Main will have a folder for each guide and will always contain the published guide as well as the chapters that make it up. There will also be sub-folders to serve as an archive as new versions of the Guide are created.
